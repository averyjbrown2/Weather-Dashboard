# Weather-Dashboard

This weather dashboard was developed to serve as a real-time weather forecast for the current day, as well as for the rest of the five day forecast. This program was intended to allow users to search for their desired location using the search input box. The desired location would then be displayed across the upper right portion of the page, and then the city name would be displayed to the left beneath the search bar, for easy reference. This page would allow users access to a simple, but effective means of obtaining the current and upcoming weather.
